# Whether an out-of-date pull request is automatically updated.
# It does so by merging its base on top of the head of the pull request.
# This is the equivalent of clicking the 'Update branch' button.
# This is useful for repositories where protected branches are used and the option
# 'Require branches to be up to date before merging' is enabled.
# Note: this only works when the branch of the pull request resides in the same repository as
#       the pull request itself.
updateBranch: true

# In what way a pull request needs to be merged. This can be:
# * merge: creates a merge commit, combining the commits from the pull request on top of
#   the base of the pull request (default)
# * rebase: places the commits from the pull request individually on top of the base of the pull request
# * squash: combines all changes from the pull request into a single commit and places the commit on top
#   of the base of the pull request
# For more information see https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-merges/
mergeMethod: squash

# Optionally specify the merge commit message format. The following template
# tags are supported:
# * {title}: The pull request title at the moment it is merged
# * {body}: The pull request body at the moment it is merged
# * {number}: The pull request number
# * {branch}: The name of the source branch
# * {commits}: A list of merged commits
# When this option is not set, the merge commit message is controlled by
# GitHub and uses a combination of the title of the pull request when it was
# opened (note that later changes to the title are ignored) and a list of
# commits.
# This settings is ignored when `mergeMethod` is set to `rebase`.
